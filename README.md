# JavaScript Image Slider

This is a simple image slider website that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a header with links for navigation and a language switch button. The main content consists of a fullscreen image that automatically transitions. At the bottom of the screen, there are cards with smaller images, allowing users to manually switch between images. Additionally, two buttons for navigating forward and backward through the images have been implemented.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Add a folder named "images" to the root directory.
3. Place your images in the "images" folder with the following naming format: "img-<number>.jpg".
